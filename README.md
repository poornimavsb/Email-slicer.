Welcome to the Email Slicer written in Python!
This is a simple terminal-based tool that takes an email address and splits it into username, domain, and domain name.

🧠 How It Works

You enter an email address (e.g. john.doe@gmail.com).

The program splits the email into:

Username – Part before @ (e.g. john.doe)

Domain – Part after @ (e.g. gmail.com)

Domain Name – Main part of the domain (e.g. gmail)


The program then prints these parts clearly.
